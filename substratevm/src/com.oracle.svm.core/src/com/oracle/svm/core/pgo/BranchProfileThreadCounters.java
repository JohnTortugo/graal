/**
 * Per-thread storage for conditional branch counters.
 *
 * Instrumented code increments a private native block owned by the executing thread, so hot
 * branches executed concurrently on many cores never write the same cache line. The block is
 * allocated in {@link #afterThreadAttach}, which runs before the thread can execute any Java code
 * (including constructing a foreign thread's {@code Thread} object), folded into the shared totals
 * when the thread exits, and read in place for still-running threads when a profile snapshot is
 * taken. Generated code therefore dereferences the thread-local without a null check. If the
 * allocation fails the thread-local points at the shared counters instead.
